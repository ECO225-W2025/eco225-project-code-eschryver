\frametitle{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Housing discrimination: long-running problem in US
    \item Common historical tactics: racial deed covenants, redlining, white flight, and blockbusting (Rothstein, 2017).
    \item Long-term effects:
    Deed covenants → Improved relative neighborhood quality (Sood, Ehrman-Solberg, 2024).
Redlining → Higher localized poverty (Appel, Nickerson, 2016).
Majority-Black neighborhoods → Lower quality of opportunity (Chetty et al., 2014).

    \item Modern discrimination persists:
    Lending disparities (Quillian, Lee, Honoré, 2020).
    Racial steering in real estate (Glenn, 2018).

\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigates whether minority move-ins suppress home-value appreciation, a key claim behind 1950s blockbusting.
    \item Uses loan data (Fannie Mae \& Freddie Mac), ACS data for normalization, and Zillow ZHVI for home prices.
    \item Methodology:
    Selects majority-white zip codes with minority move-ins (2009-2010).
    Tracks change in minority move-in share (2012-2013) as treatment.
    Analyzes home price appreciation over six years (until 2019).    
    \item Findings: The relationship between minority move-in share and home-value appreciation is unclear—while the treatment group shows lower appreciation, variation is extremely high.
